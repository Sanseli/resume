        I’ve been working as a software developer since 2019, and because I love being creative I’m mostly interested and experienced in the front-end area.

        In my free time I enjoy spending time with my cats, hiking, and diving into the wondrous world of fantasy games. And I also worked on crafting some cosplays in the past.
